How to edit in inspector:\
Making new symbols: In the slot manager, add the symbol's int value in the symbols list, then add the payout for the symbol on the payouts list. (Note: the symbol index should be the same as its payout index)\
Making new patterns: In the slot manager, add a new element to the reel patterns list. The reel pattern should have a size of 5, and each element can be listed as Top, Mid, Bot.\
Editing reel symbols: In reel behaviour, add new elements to the row values list. (Note: element should be a symbol in the symbols list in slot manager)

What are possible improvement to the project?\
While functionally, the project is a slot machine. It lacks "juice", and would improve gameplay experience greatly by adding more visual and auditory effects. In terms of VFX, an animation or particle effects would be instantiated to the scene depending on the amount of total winnings the player gets in a spin, with grander VFX on bigger wins. Simple animations on idle would make the scene seem less static outside of spinning. In terms of SFX, background music would be a good start to prevent the scene from feeling empty. SFX on wins to compliment the win animations would also make winning feel more rewarding. Lastly, SFX on buttons like spin, increase/decrease bet, and while the reels are spinning to give the player some feedback that they have pressed a button and something has happened.

Some quality of life improvements could also be added like an auto-spin feature, with an option to stop if player money goes below a certain player set point. A feature could also be added to make the game unique to other slot machine games, like an art gallery that has unique artwork based on the games theme that you can unlock by getting highly specific patterns with specific symbols. Some voiced dialogue from a game character that cheers the player on as they get more wins.
